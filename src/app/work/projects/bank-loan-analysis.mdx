## Overview

This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data, leveraging SQL for robust data querying and manipulation. The analysis is complemented by advanced visualization and further exploration using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights concerning loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower demographics.

## Objectives

- **Comprehensive Portfolio Assessment**: Provide a detailed assessment of the bank's loan portfolio performance, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Trend Analysis**: Discover patterns in loan applications, approval rates, and repayment statuses to optimize lending strategies.
- **Financial Health Evaluation**: Evaluate financial health indicators such as Total Funded Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Loan Status to gauge portfolio stability and profitability.
- **Strategic Decision Support**: Support strategic decision-making for enhancing the bank's credit and loan offerings, ensuring alignment with market demands and customer needs.

## Methodology

### Data Ingestion and Database Creation
Established a robust foundation in Microsoft SQL Server for storing comprehensive loan data, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for all analysis tools.

### Data Analysis and SQL Queries
Developed SQL queries to retrieve essential KPIs including:
- Total and monthly loan applications
- Funded amounts and average interest rates
- Loan status breakdowns
- Borrower demographics analysis
- Geographic distribution
- Temporal trends

### Data Processing in Excel
Performed data cleaning, validation, and preliminary analysis using Excel to ensure accuracy before advanced visualization.

### Categorization of Loans
Classified loans into 'Good' or 'Bad' based on repayment status, providing clear distinction between performing and non-performing loans for risk assessment.

### Multi-dimensional Analysis
Conducted detailed analysis based on multiple factors:
- Issue month (temporal patterns)
- State (geographical analysis)
- Loan term
- Employee length
- Loan purpose
- Home ownership status

### Advanced Visualization
Created interactive dashboards using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau to transform data into actionable visual insights with dynamic filtering capabilities.

## Key Insights and Findings

- **Loan Portfolio Performance**: Comprehensive assessment of loan applications, funding, and repayment statuses
- **Geographic Analysis**: State-level analysis of loan distribution and performance
- **Temporal Trends**: Monthly trends in loan applications and funding
- **Borrower Demographics**: Analysis of borrower characteristics including employment, home ownership, and income
- **Risk Assessment**: Classification of loans into performing and non-performing categories
- **Financial Metrics**: Evaluation of interest rates, loan amounts, and DTI ratios
- **Loan Purpose Analysis**: Understanding the reasons behind loan applications
- **Approval Patterns**: Insights into loan approval rates and funding decisions

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server**: Database management, querying, and data analysis
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, processing, and pivot table visualizations
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation with dynamic filtering
- **Tableau**: Advanced data visualization and interactive dashboards

## Project Highlights

### Power BI Dashboard
Interactive dashboards providing real-time insights into loan data with comprehensive filtering and drill-down capabilities.

### Tableau Visualization
Advanced visualizations showcasing complex data relationships and trends in loan portfolio performance.

### Excel Analysis
Preliminary analysis and data processing with pivot tables and compelling charts.

### SQL Queries
Extracted key metrics and KPIs for in-depth analysis of loan portfolio performance.

## Key Terminologies

- **Loan ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application
- **Loan Status**: Current state (fully paid, current, default)
- **Grade & Sub Grade**: Risk classification based on creditworthiness
- **DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)**: Borrower's debt burden relative to income
- **Interest Rate**: Annual cost of borrowing
- **Loan Amount**: Total borrowed sum
- **Purpose**: Reason for the loan (debt consolidation, education, etc.)
- **Term**: Duration of the loan in months
