## Overview

A comprehensive HR Analytics portfolio project that provides a holistic view of workforce assessment, attrition analysis, and employee demographics. This project demonstrates expertise in data analysis, visualization, and database management using SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Tableau.

## Key Objectives

- **Comprehensive Workforce Assessment**: Provide a detailed assessment of the organization's workforce performance, identifying strengths and areas for improvement in employee retention and satisfaction.
- **Trend Analysis**: Discover patterns in employee attrition across departments, gender, age groups, and job roles to optimize workforce strategies.
- **HR Metrics Evaluation**: Evaluate key metrics such as Attrition Rate, Average Age, Job Satisfaction, and Employee Count to gauge workforce stability and engagement.
- **Strategic Decision Support**: Support data-driven decision-making for enhancing employee retention programs.

## Methodology

### Data Ingestion and Database Creation
Established a robust PostgreSQL database foundation for storing comprehensive HR data, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for all analysis tools.

### Data Analysis and SQL Queries
Developed SQL queries to extract essential KPIs including:
- Total employee count
- Attrition count and rate
- Active employees
- Average age
- Department-wise attrition
- Job satisfaction ratings
- Education field analysis
- Age group trends

### Data Processing in Excel
Performed data cleaning, validation, and preliminary analysis using pivot tables to ensure accuracy before advanced visualization.

### Multi-dimensional Analysis
Conducted detailed analysis based on multiple factors:
- Gender
- Age bands
