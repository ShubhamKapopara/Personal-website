## Overview

BookShelf is a full-stack bookstore management system built during my Semester 8 internship. It provides users with a seamless online book browsing and purchasing experience, while offering an admin dashboard to manage books, users, and orders.

## Key Features

- **Book Browsing & Checkout**: Browse books by category, add to cart, and complete purchases through a secure checkout flow.  
- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure login/registration with JWT for protecting user data.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full control to add/edit/delete books, manage user accounts, and process orders.  
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights for admins into sales, order status, book inventory, and user activity.  
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Strong input validation and exception handling to ensure data integrity.  

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)  
- **Tools**: Postman (API testing), MVC (controllers/models/routes)  

## Challenges and Learnings

- Learned to manage state and routing in React with proper separation between client and server logic.  
- Secured communication between frontend and backend, especially authentication.  
- Designed well-structured REST APIs with clear endpoints and input validation.  
- Gained experience balancing UI design with backend functionality.  

## Outcome

BookShelf demonstrated my ability to build and deliver real-world full-stack applications. It strengthened my skills in frontend/backend integration, authentication flows, database management, and API design, preparing me for larger-scale projects.
