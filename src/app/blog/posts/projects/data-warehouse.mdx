## Project Overview

This project involved engineering a comprehensive ETL pipeline to populate an OLAP data warehouse with over 1 million rows of data from PubMed in under 3 minutes. I led a team of 3 developers and proposed a star schema architecture designed to analyze trends amongst articles and authors.

## Key Achievements

### ETL Pipeline Performance
- **Engineered ETL pipeline** to populate OLAP data warehouse in less than 3 minutes with 1million+ rows from PubMed
- Optimized data processing and transformation workflows for maximum efficiency

### Team Leadership
- **Led a team of 3** developers through the entire project lifecycle
- Coordinated development efforts and ensured project milestones were met

### Architecture Design
- **Proposed a star schema architecture** with the intent to analyze trends amongst articles and author
- Designed scalable data warehouse structure optimized for analytical queries

## Technical Skills

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **R**
- ETL Pipeline Development
- OLAP Data Warehouse Design
- Star Schema Architecture
- Data Modeling

## Impact

The star schema architecture enables efficient analysis of trends across PubMed articles and authors, providing valuable insights for research and academic purposes. The optimized ETL pipeline ensures data freshness and supports real-time analytics capabilities.
